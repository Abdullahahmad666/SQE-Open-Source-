Notes of First Meeting
We started finding open source projects to work for understanding the non functional requirements. After our long survey, we found three projects.

First: tensorflow(Machine Learning )
Following is github link of TenserFlow mobile app https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

Second: Open Source Machine Learning named as Django
Link of github code of that project is https://github.com/django/django


So we will work on these projects for this assignment.
